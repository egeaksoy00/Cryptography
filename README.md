# Cryptography

A collection of small, educational cryptography projects written in Java.  
This repository serves as a hands-on playground for learning fundamental concepts of classical encryption, brute-force attacks, key spaces, and simple cryptanalysis techniques.

Each mini-project focuses on a different cipher or cryptographic idea, helping build strong foundations for more advanced topics like hashing, symmetric/asymmetric encryption, and modern security protocols.

## 📚 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

- Learn cryptography step-by-step through practical coding  
- Build intuition for how encryption and decryption actually work  
- Understand the weaknesses of classical ciphers  
- Experiment with brute-force attacks and key search  
- Maintain a growing portfolio of cryptography tools  

This repo will expand over time with more ciphers and tools.
